<Paragraph
	><a href="https://www.merchant-gourmet.com/">Merchant Gourmet</a> is a provider of high-quality
	cook's ingredients that helps people bring the flavours of the world into their own homes. I was
	the lead developer on this site build while contracting for the west-London agency
	<a href="https://www.bigfish.co.uk/">BigFish</a>.</Paragraph

<Paragraph
	>The site features a wide range of content, from products to recipes and travel writing that
	features ingredients found in the worlds local cuisines.</Paragraph

<Paragraph
	>The UK is a hub for global food culture. The British pallet has expanded hugely since the 1980s
	and 90s with the British public embracing foods not only from the places of old-empire, but also
	globally. London, for example, is a fantastic place to find authentic examples of the world's
	cuisine. From vegan Ethiopian food in Petticoat Lane, to Sushi or Ceviche in Soho, to Portugues in
	Stockwell or Vietnamese or Indian in Shoreditch, the brits know and love the flavours of the
	world.</Paragraph

<Paragraph
	>Merchant Gourmet brings that warm embrace of world food culture into your kitchen through great
	ingredients and plenty of inspiration. It was a pleasure working with <a
		href="https://www.bigfish.co.uk/">BigFish</a
	> on this build.</Paragraph
